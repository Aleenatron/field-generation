\chapter{Conclusion}
The potential in a procedure using the Kriging Method as an field exploration technique with UAVs was demonstrated. By characterizing the confidence of the Kriging predictions made from observations in a field, along with a natural neighbor selection technique, a method for path-planning was developed to increase overall confidence in prediction of a target field as a whole.
