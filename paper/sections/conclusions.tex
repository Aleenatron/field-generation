\chapter{Conclusion}
The potential in a procedure using the Kriging Method as the core of a field exploration technique with an autonomous vehicle was demonstrated. By characterizing the confidence of the Kriging predictions made from observations in a field, along with uncertainty supressing motivated path planners, the overall confidence in prediction of a target field as a whole can be maximized without having to scan every point.
