\chapter*{Conclusion}
The potential in a procedure using the Kriging Method as the core of a field exploration technique with an autonomous vehicle was demonstrated. By characterizing the confidence of the Kriging predictions made from observations in a field, along with uncertainty suppressing motivated path planners, the overall confidence in prediction of a target field as a whole can be maximized without having to scan every point. Furthermore, variance motivated path planning for prediction uncertainty suppression was shown to yield better results for equal path lengths compared to predetermined paths.

An exploration vehicle could be maneuvered through a field to collect samples in areas of low Kriging prediction confidence. This in turn can increase the quality of prediction of the target field's state of interest to a higher degree of certainty. Using the Kriging variance generated path planning techniques, a more accurate prediction of a target field, though explored with the same path lengths as a fixed path spiral formation, was generated. The three path planners introduced to accomplish this task were compared to one another, and found to be roughly twice as accurate as the predetermined path planning technique they were compared against.
