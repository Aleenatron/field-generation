\chapter*{Conclusion}
The potential in a procedure using the Kriging Method as the core of a field exploration technique with an autonomous vehicle was demonstrated. By characterizing the confidence of the Kriging predictions made from observations in a field, along with uncertainty suppressing motivated path planners, the overall confidence in prediction of a target field as a whole can be maximized without having to scan every point. Furthermore, variance motivated path planning for prediction uncertainty suppression was shown to yield better results for equal path lengths compared to predetermined paths.

An exploration vehicle could be maneuvered through a field to collect samples in areas of low Kriging prediction confidence. This in turn can increase the quality of prediction of the target field's state of interest to a higher degree of certainty. Using the Kriging variance generated path planning techniques, a more accurate prediction of a target field, though explored with the same path lengths as a fixed path spiral formation, was generated. 

By simulating the three introduced path planners as well as the predetermined zig-zag method, it was shown that the prediction errors of a variance motivated path planner outperformed that of a predetermined maneuver. For highly autocorrelated target fields, it was found that ... For target fields with low autocorrelation, it was found that ...

\chapter*{Future Work}
Future works can be done in an effort to further develop Kriging prediction variance motivated path planning techniques. A method which filters noisy measurement on a target field, with potentially dynamic properties, using a Kalman Filtering technique may be in the interest of a variance motivated path planner. The field states of a potentially dynamic field can be estimated using a Kalman Filter. The variances from both the Kalman filter state estimates, along with the Kriging prediction variances, could then potentially be fused in an effort to better track the states of a dynamic field by constructing paths along the field that suppress overall Kalman filter variances and Kriging prediction variances. This would ideally, in turn, produce predictions with higher certainty of state estimate for the overall field. The method could then also be used to help determine if a vehicle is suitable for tracking a certain state about the field. For example, if the dynamics of the field are found to be too dynamic for a simulated vehicle with a fixed velocity to track, while minimizing Kriging prediction variances and Kalman state variances, a more suitable vehicle might be chosen instead for that field.

Further work could also be the development of a comparison of the introduced methods, for varying vehicle dynamics, e.g. a Dubins Vehicle.
