\noindent A special thanks to Renwick E. Curry for helping me complete this thesis. Ren helped me tremendously with all aspects of this work. He also taught me the following: we do simulations to answer certain questions, but the results of the simulations raise even more questions. Sharon Rabinovich helped me settle on a thesis topic, and pointed me to the area of spatial statistics, which proved to be very fruitful. Max Lichtenstein was very helpful throughout this work. We drew out many ideas on the white board which helped me converge on a number of methods introduced in this thesis. My other colleagues in The Autonomous Systems Lab at UC Santa Cruz: Jordan Liss, Pavlo Vlastos, and Wuyuan Chen were all helpful, insightful, and good company when I was writing this thesis. Yerba Mate fueled me for most of this thesis.\\
