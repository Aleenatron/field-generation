\chapter{Simulation Framework}
A simulation of the path planning algorithm was created to demonstrate the ability of the described method. The simulation includes a software in the loop vehicle with variable dynamics, a randomly generated variable autocorrelated field of variable size, and a path planning algorithm based on the the Algorithm introduced in \ref{alg:uncert}. The simulation also incorporates the ability to follow a preplanned route. The simulation will be used to demonstrate the abilities of the algorithm described, and comparisons to an algorithm with a preplanned trajectory.
