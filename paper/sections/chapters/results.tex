\section{Comparing The Method}
% talk about the zig zag (w/ & wo/ kriging predictions)
% compared against the zig zag

\subsection{Varying Target Field Sizes}

% table :
% zig zag w/o krig predictions - zig zag w/ krig predictions - chasing the dragon (going to the max variance) - my method

% compare
% arc length (amount traversed supposed to represent energy expenditure and time)
% RMS error
% number of waypoints (not carrots) set
% rate of change of variance drops

% 20x runs of each and get average from each
% for fields 50x50, 100x100, 250x250, 500x500, 1000x1000
% show final pictures of at least one of each method

\subsection{Varying Autocorrelation}
% table :
% zig zag w/o krig predictions - zig zag w/ krig predictions - chasing the dragon (going to the max variance) - my method

% compare
% arc length (amount traversed supposed to represent energy expenditure and time)
% RMS error
% number of waypoints (not carrots) set
% rate of change of variance drops

% 20x runs of each and get average from each
% for autocorrelations 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

% show final pictures of at least one of each method
