\section{Exploration Simulation}
Though the simulation has the ability to terminate itself when a minimum derivative of confidence is achieved, the number of exploration iterations will be limited to $10$ to better demonstrate and compare the characteristics of the algorithm for varying field sizes.

    \label{tab:krg_vs_krg}
\end{table}

The results in Table \ref{tab:krg_vs_krg} convey trends in the algorithm. For a fixed number of exploration iterations, the arc length (the total distance traveled) increases as the square size of the field increases. This result is expected, as more area must be covered to reduce the overall uncertainty of the area's prediction. The final error is calculated by taking the frobenius norm of matrix difference of the final predicted field and the generated target field for that exploration. The final error increases as the field size increases. The increase in error arises from limiting the exploration iterations. This result is shown in order to convey the need for the algorithm to run more iterations for larger field sizes.

\subsection{Varying Target Field Sizes}
The effectiveness of the method introduced varies based on the area of the target field being explored. For small fields, a naive zig-zag exploration may be more efficient and less computationally expensive. By modulating the dimensions of the target field, a comparison can be drawn demonstrating the effectiveness of the method versus a naive zig-zag approach.
